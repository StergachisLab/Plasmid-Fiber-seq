1. Run aligned and sorted bam files through pyft_sort notebook
	- This seperates out plasmid and genomic reads, and sorts plasmid reads by nucleosomes count

2. Extract m6a bed files from nucleosome count sorted bams and place them in the bed folder of their designated hmm folder
	- Eg. place m6a.bed files in Gus_WT_rep1 --> Infiles --> Bed

3. Ensure that the accessible and inaccessible probability files are in the References folder, along with the pickled model file and the reference.h5 file

4. Run prep_bed script

5. Run apply_model_circular script
	- There are two scripts. apply_model_circular_exact is for m6a files that came from a bam file that only contains reads of the exact plasmid length. apply_model_circular is for m6a files that came from bam files with +/- 100bp buffer for plasmid read lengths


6. Analyze data using the basic-plots-pol-II jupyter notebook
